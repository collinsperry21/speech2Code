Guide to navigating speechToCode !
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Stating speec2code

Speech2code will start by asking you for voice input


1. Begin by saying the line "open file" if you wish to create or open an existing
file. Speech2code will by default open the file "start.py" if you at first don't
say "open file".
    a. Say the name of the existing file or name of the file you are about to create,
    if one doesn't exist already

The following list is a menu of options for how you could proceed, in no specific order.


A. Help manual
B. Exiting speech2code
C. Write code
D. Run a file
E. Read a file
F. Open/Create a file


Option A: Help manual
When you see the prompt "Waiting for voice input..."
Say "help", and this help manual document will display

Option B: Exit speech2code
When you see the prompt "Waiting for voice input..."
Say "end speech to code" to exit

Option C: Write code mode
When you see the prompt "Waiting for voice input..."
Say "write"
This will then trigger several options for you by first asking you "What would you like to write"?
Choose one of the following:

  Option C1: Comment
    Say "comment" to comment on the current line
    At the prompt "You are commenting to line#: <#>" ... say your comment.

  Option C2: Variable
    Say "variable" to create a variable
    At the prompt "Please say your variable name: <varName>" say the desired name for your variable
    Then, at the following prompt "Value: <inputValue>"  say whatever value you would like to assign
    to this variable

  Option C3: String
    Say "string" to create a string.
    At the prompt "Enter the contents of your string".... say what you want your string to hold

  Option C4: Exit the write code mode
    Say "exit write" to exit the write code mode.

Option D: Edit a file
    When you see the prompt "Waiting for voice input..." say "edit file" to begin editing the
    currently open file.
    At the prompt "Say the line number in the file you want to edit: " say the desired line number.

Option E: Run the current file
  When you see the prompt "Waiting for voice input..."
  Say "run file" to run the file yor are currently on.

Option F: Read a file
    When you see the prompt "Waiting for voice input..."
    Say "read"

Option G: Open an existing file to work on or create a new one to work on.
  When you see the prompt "Waiting for voice input..."
  Say "open file"
  This will call the openfile() function and display: "Say File Name to open: <inputFileName>"
  At this point you have these two options:
    F1: If you want to open an existing file in your working directory, say its name.
    F2: If you want to create a new file to begin working on it, just say the name that you
    would like to call this file, and it will create and open it for you to start working on it

Option H: Switch to another file that you've already created.
    When you see the prompt "Waiting for voice input..."
    Say "switch file" to initiate the switch to another file.
    At the prompt "Enter the already created file name you wish to switch too"
    Say the desired file name, and that file will become the currently open file
